# EasyDoc: Decentralized Healthcare Document Management

## Project Overview

EasyDoc is a full-stack application designed to modernize and streamline healthcare document management, addressing the inefficiencies and complexities patients often face with scattered paper documents and disparate online portals. Our goal is to provide a seamless, secure, and patient-centric solution for accessing and sharing healthcare information.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for EasyDoc stemmed from the critical need to improve the healthcare industry's document flow. Patients are frequently burdened with managing a clutter of paper documents and navigating multiple standalone online portals, a process that is not only time-consuming but also highly susceptible to errors. We sought to create a solution that simplifies this experience for patients and facilitates secure information exchange among healthcare providers.

## What It Does

EasyDoc empowers patients with a decentralized profile, enabling them to securely view all their healthcare documents from various medical specialties in one centralized location. Beyond just viewing, the platform facilitates HIPAA-compliant release procedures, allowing for seamless and secure delivery of these documents between doctors of different specialties. This ensures that critical patient information is accessible to relevant healthcare providers when needed, while maintaining strict privacy standards.

## Technology Stack

EasyDoc was built as a full-stack application leveraging the **MERN stack**:

* **MongoDB**: For the database, managing user data and healthcare documents.
* **Express.js**: As the backend web application framework for building APIs.
* **React.js**: For developing the dynamic and user-friendly frontend interface.
* **Node.js**: As the JavaScript runtime environment for the backend.

This stack was utilized to manage user logins, present patient and doctor dashboards, and handle the requesting and viewing of document releases.

## Challenges We Ran Into

One of the significant challenges encountered during development was integrating a **MongoDB cluster with the frontend**. We faced considerable difficulty connecting the database to our project, which required overcoming multiple firewall and network hurdles before a successful resolution was achieved.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of

We are particularly proud of the **user interface (UI)** developed for EasyDoc. It was put together very neatly and concisely, effectively displaying all necessary information to both patients and doctors without any issues.

## What We Learned

The entire team gained invaluable experience in **full-stack development**. Whether working on the frontend using React or managing the database and API with Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, every team member expanded their skillset significantly.

## What's Next for EasyDoc

Looking ahead, the next steps for EasyDoc involve:

* Developing extra procedures to accommodate a large pool of patient profiles.
* Developing a sustainable business model to facilitate the deployment of this application to doctors and healthcare institutions around the world.
